# Page Rank Algorithm Implementation

I implemented PageRank algorithm as described in "Mining Massive Datasets" class from Stanford University via Coursera. The video lecture can be found at https://class.coursera.org/mmds-002/lecture/29. This project is implemented in Java.

## Dataset

The dataset, a subset of the web graph, was downloaded from http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Google.txt.gz. It contains 875,713 nodes and 5,105,039 edges. Each line in the file represents a directed edge in the graph, containing two numbers which are separated by a space. For example, "x y" means an edge from node x to node y.
